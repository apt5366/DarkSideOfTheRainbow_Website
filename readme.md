Built a SpringBoot Application using Javaâ€™s Spring Framework and H2 database forming a Music Store website to store a catalog of albums virtually.
Developed an adjoining admin page protected via login for store owners to add, delete, and edit current information about albums like name, artist, songs, etc.
Enhanced accessibility by adding navigation and search bar along with more JavaScript and CSS features.

To run, go to src>main>java>com.oneupalbums>controller folder, and run IndexController class, then view the terminal to see what port the site has become active on. Finally, on your default browser, type in 
'localhost:8080/' on the search bar on top.
