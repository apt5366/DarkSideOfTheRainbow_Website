Built a SpringBoot Application using Javaâ€™s Spring Framework and H2 database forming a Music Store website to store a catalog of albums virtually.
Developed an adjoining admin page protected via login for store owners to add, delete, and edit current information about albums like name, artist, songs, etc.
